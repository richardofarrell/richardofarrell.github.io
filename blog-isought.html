        <h2 class="center-text">Why Scientific Objectivism and Moral Relativism are Incompatible</h2>
            <p>The is-ought distinction receives unwarranted attention in discussions of whether morality is objective. 
              You can't derive an ought from an is. True enough. Nor, for that matter, can you get an is out of an ought, an orange out of a banana, or a fish from a frog. 
              And yet reasonable people are seduced by the idea that acknowledgment of this simple fact - that is's and oughts are different linguistic entities - somehow spells the undoing of moral realism.</p>
              
            <p>This is invariably little more than a pessimistic hangover; that is, a symptom of failing to take seriously the fundamental importance of knowledge-creation in the moral sphere. The wish to relegate knowledge creation to parochial cognitive machinery is almost always a comorbidity of anti-realism – be it moral, epistemological or metaphysical. Yet knowledge has almost nothing to do with logic, strange as that may sound even to the most esteemed of thinkers. Describing Popper's <i>Logic of Scientific Discovery</i>, a bemused Herbert Simon, for one, balked at just how 'unusual' it was, as he put it,
                'for an author, less than one-tenth of the way through his work, to disclaim the existence of the subject matter that the title of his treatise announces.'</p>
              
            <p>But behind Simon's bemusement lies an important distinction: namely, that denying the supremacy of logic is not in itself tantamount to any concession that knowledge somehow be <i>illogical</i>, or worse, irrational. Rather, it may be said that knowledge <i>creation</i> – the constructive or generative component of a theory's formation – is, unlike the critical component – that of theory-testing – quite simply an altogether a-logical business. This is how Popper saw it. Popper viewed criticism as a (temporally) secondary logical process which, added to the solute of an unsupported (indeed, unsupportable) conjecture, could yield a solution to a problem. With the crucial proviso that we not charm ourselves into the fatal idea that a solution can be final; for that amounts to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rather unlike chemical solutions, the epistemological solution is always incomplete and hence, never a solution in any ultimate sense. The word 'solution', then, is merely shorthand for a new set of problems.</p>
    
            <p>What relevance does knowledge-creation have in a discussion of morality and the is-ought gap? The point is to demonstrate the poverty of reasoning from logical gappism to moral relativisim, instrumentalism, or any other variety of subjectivism on offer. The argument, in other words, is that the is-ought gap is, for all intents and purposes, identical to the logical gaps we are quite accustomed to ignoring in our scientific investigations. Much as we may gloss over the awkward fact that scientific claims can't be logically derived, justified, or grounded anymore than can their moral counterparts, the gaps are there and they are there to stay. Those sceptical should be deeply concerned by the existence of what I'm going to call the (albeit less catchy) "don't-can't" gap. </p>
            
            <p>This unholy beast of a thing, the don't-can't gap, is a logical barricade, which, if breached, constitutes commission of the don't-can't fallacy. In words, this happens whenever someone misidentifies a contingent tendency (essentially any trend or pattern in the world) for a necessary <i>law</i> of nature. It is pervasively encouraged within psychology – for instance, whenever a researcher deduces from the average participant's performance on a battery of validated measures the errant conclusion that say, humans cannot, for whatever confluence of environmental and inborn factors, tie their shoelaces. 
              Thus we have leapt from a mere tendency (that they <i>don't</i> do it very well) to a fundemental limit (i.e., they <i>can't</i> do it) of human nature.</p>
            
            <p>A good psychologist may go very far in this vein. She may offer what appear to be explanations for the observed impairment, pointing out that people possess a severe bias against tying shoelaces; or better still, that there exists an evolutionarily conserved module in the brain which has left us ill-equipped to handle the modern technological demands of tying shoelaces at the rate necessitated by today's increasingly laced society. Self-help shelves will, all things going well, meet the societal demand by stocking books about how to raise teenagers in a laceless world. They may offer various rules and principles regarding what to do when your teen asks for their first pair of sneakers. Others will satisfy themselves with relaying the interesting fact that gut health promotes rudimentary knot-tying abilities in certain subcultures. The more balanced commentators will offer reassurance: yes, while evidently inferior, when worn during public rituals, out in nature or during periods of trauma, velcro can nonetheless act as a highly adaptive socio-emotional adhesive. </p>
            
            <p>Parody aside, the don't-can't gap is logically airtight; it is never logically permissible to attempt to derive a 'cannot' from a 'does not'. And just like the is/ought gap, we really <i>ought</i> to consider this an entirely irrelevant point of confusion on the part of its source. It has zero relevance to our theorising, precisely because theorising is (again, unlike the critical tonic) not a matter of 'deriving' anything from anything. It would be an incredibly dull state of affairs were this the case.</p> 
            
            <p>Fortunately it isn't how things are. In science, we make conjectures, then we criticise them. The good ones stick around – until they don't. At this point we rejoice in their magical failure, and then continue - raising and sacrificing one theory after another. It really isn't too far off to frame it as magic, followed by logic, on a never-ending loop. If clean derivations were the aim, we would, quite literally, have made zero progress. The simple fact that faster than light travel has tended not to happen, or for the more pedantic among us – has <i>never</i> happened – is, for instance, not a logical case for its impossibility. Yet we know that travelling faster than the speed of light is impossible, and neither you nor I would ever wish to say that this knowledge militates against the objectivity of science. Not even a little bit. Instead of wasting thoughts on these endeavours, we can and must throw out 'derivability' as a desirable criterion. And not because, as thinkers like Sam Harris have argued, science is the primary, or the only game in town, but because conjecture and criticism is.</p>
            
            <p>All of which is simply to say – if the is-ought gap somehow bars the possibility of an objective moral theory, then so too the possibility of an objective scientific theory is barred by the don't-can't gap. Along with the is-must gap, for good measure. This should hardly be surprising, given that these so-called 'violations' are merely cases mirroring what is considered by some as the problem of induction. I say 'considered by some' because there is, strictly speaking, no problem of induction – only the faint appearance of one.</p>
            
            <p>But one might quibble that there appears to be something fishy going on. Aha! The two logical violations aren't equivalent, one might contest. The is-ought gap is a violation which pertains to distinct <i>classes</i> of statements – those about how things descriptively are, and those about some other altogether undefinable class of non-descriptive, otherworldly clauses. The don't-can't gap, on the other hand, is a logical violation involving statements of the same species: namely, about the world which exists before our eyes.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, this will also get you nowhere fast – because it's quite simply false. It's false that a claim about how the world 'can't' (or conversely, 'must') be is somehow more directly 'about' the physcial world than is a claim about how it 'ought' to be. Musts, oughts, shoulds, can'ts; these are <i>all</i> varieties of the unobservable. You don't observe a scientific law anymore than you observe beauty, logic, or morality. Again, if this abhors you, you are welcome to dislodge baby with bathwater. But you will be rejecting the objectivity of the speed of light, the conservation of energy, entropy, and so on. If you wish to argue for one kind of objectivity, but not the other, it rests upon you to demonstrate how the two logical violations are different in a way that should matter.</p>
