# What makes scientific holism so uniqely bad

What makes holism particularly terrible is that it, unlike reductionism, doesn’t explain anything. It doesn’t explain anything because it doesn’t think explanation is possible. Holism is seductive. It will always have the upper hand because it is trivially speaking true. Including more stuff in any model of the world (and of course, cursorily dressing it up with fancy shmancy talk about ‘networks’ and ‘systems’ and 'interactions' and various gestures at emergence and coarse-graining and so forth) will always yield a superficially ‘better’ description of what it is you’re trying to explain.

But there’s the rub. Holism is entirely descriptive. Holism, at its very core, rejects the possibility of explaining the world. It embodies the belief that our goal is to faithfully reproduce things in their entire ugliness rather than to better understand them, and in doing so, to learn anything. Whereas reductionism can at least produce interesting explanations which may or may not be false – like for instance, gravity is the curvature of spacetime – holism offers no such consolation. It is the theoretical equivalent of a loud and pessimistic belching noise.

Now add to this the inconvenient fact that a truly holistic theory is impossible. There’s always more context to be had, more processes to interact, and hence more wholes to fill(!) whether they be lurking very long ago in the Big Bang or very far away in the big, big cosmos. Taken seriously, it implies that the goal of science is to simulate the universe from start to finish. Since this can’t be done, holism is not only anti-scientific, but false. And again, ugly – so very ugly. And boring.
