# Unholy Arguments from Probability

I recently had the misfortune of listening to a group of people discussing whether it's reasonable to believe in God. The conversation was, unsurprisingly, very dull – with both sides appealing to various arguments from authority, throwing the burden-of-proof potato back and forth ad nauseum. One of the claims struck me, however. It struck me in particular because it demonstrated why probabilistic reasoning is so often invalid when tackling empirical and epistemological questions.

The argument went something as follows:

A conjunction of statements can only be less likely, or equally as likely, as either statement on its own.

Consider the argument for God's existence a conjunction of two probabilities: *P* (Observable reality exists) & *P* (God exists).

Since the conjunction cannot be as probable as the individual claim that reality exists, we should prefer to say that reality exists, instead of saying reality and God exist.

Now, there are several issues with an argument like this. First, there's a missing premise. Why should we prefer to say that reality exists, rather than say that God exists? Each of the individual claims must be more likely than the conjunction! The missing assumption assumes that reality is already certain. Which is obviously question-begging. Also, the conjunction of *P* (Reality exists) & *P* (God exists) isn't equivalent to the statement that reality exists *because* God exists, which is what religious typically want to claim. In other words, there's a conditional baked into the religious argument which has been omitted. The more relevant question is something like the following Bayesian computation:

$$\mathPr(God | Reality) = \frac{Pr(Reality | God) Pr(God)}{Pr(Reality)} $$

Of course, any attempt to calculate this is meaningless drivel. Unsurprisingly, many have in fact tried to do it and come up with numbers to support whichever side of the argument they originally wished to endorse.

The deeper issue with all of this is not so much that *P* (getting anything interesting | some speculative probabilities) is near zero. The issue is that probabilistic reasoning is itself a blunt instrument in many ways.

It's easier to see this with another example. Take the claim that the Earth revolves around the sun and add to it the claim that it does so in ellipses: *P* (Earth orbits the Sun) & *P* (Earth moves in ellipses). These are distinguishable claims, in that one can see how the Earth could orbit the sun while moving in a different way, and similarly it could be true that the Earth moves elliptically, but just not around the sun. What's more, we know the claims to be independently true, albeit never with certainty. It may be that the Earth's orbit is in fact being miscalculated, or that the appearance of the sun is a hologram. Obviously, these are absurd things to think, but they're the kinds of things which prevent you from ever rounding up to *P* = 1. So we have two very likely but not certain claims – meaning that together, their conjunction is indeed less likely than either one of them. Now the question to consider is: what does this mathematical information achieve? One problem is that it implies, as Popper pointed out, that we should prefer theories which are almost devoid of any content at all. In other words, we should prefer to say that the Earth exists much more than we should wish to say that it exists, travels round the sun, does so in ellipses, speeds up the closer it gets, all the while spinning on its axis.

Here's David Deutsch providing a better refutation of probabilistic reasoning:

  > the conjunction (T₁ & T₂) of two mutually inconsistent explanatory theories T₁ and T₂ (such as quantum theory and relativity) is provably false, and therefore has zero probability. Yet it embodies some understanding of the world and is definitely better than nothing.

In other words, many of our theories are inconsistent with each other, and therefore together, cannot possess a probability above zero. Well, fine. The issue Deutsch is pointing to, however, is that if we're choosing probability as our yardstick, then something has clearly gone wrong. When a measure purporting to account for scientific progress attributes 0 to both general relativity and quantum mechanics, with no way of capturing anything valuable in either domain, something has gone wrong. We know that relativity and quantum mechanics embody some kind of understanding, however paltry it may someday seem. A system which dismisses all of that isn't a system worth wanting. In fact, it probably destroys most, if not all existing science.

Deutsch goes on:

  > Furthermore if we expect, with Popper, that all our best theories of fundamental physics are going to be superseded eventually, and we therefore believe their negations, it is still those false theories, not their true negations, that constitute all our deepest knowledge of physics.

The mere fact that most of what we think now is bound to be misconceived implies, on a purely probabilistic basis, that at some point the negations of most of our theories will, in fact, turn out to be true. This leaves us with the even more perverse conclusion that we should, if only in expectation, prefer the negations of our best theories. Again, not something we'd hope for from a theory of knowledge.

Bayes' theorem doesn't get you out of the difficulty. 'Bayesianism' offers a method of reformulating probabilities in terms of credences, or degrees of belief. The idea is that we test a bunch of models using different parameters each time, and then whichever model has the highest, narrowest posterior likelihood distribution (penalised by the number of its parameters), is the best one. Credences, in general, are not taken to be frequencies or propensities, but are considered to nonetheless obey the probability calculus – they sum to 1, and so on.

To this, Deutsch points out that the negation of an explanatory theory is not itself explanatory. That is, there exists a difference in kind. If it were true that we were trying to maximise our credences, it would need to be the case that whatever is maximised by our credence in a true explanation is completely absent from our credences in its negation ~T. But since credences are supposed to obey the probability calculus, our credence ~T is greater than zero.

All of that is to say – I probably won't be attending any more discussions about God or his purported existence.
