# 5 Steps to the Destruction of Philosophy

Empiricism took five positive turns after Hume, according to Quine:

>“The first is the shift from ideas to words. The second is the shift of semantic focus from terms to sentences. The third is the shift of semantic focus from sentences to systems of sentences. The fourth is, in Morton White’s phrase, methodological monism: the abandonment of the analytic-synthetic distinction. The fifth is naturalism: abandonment of the goal of a first philosophy prior to science.”

The first turn – from ideas to words – was accomplished by the British empiricists. Concerned, as Quine says, to 'make sense out of the senses', to ground knowledge on an empirically observable basis, the empiricists diagnosed 'ideas' as problematic because of their abstract character. What was abstract was not translatable into any kind of sense data, and what could not be said in sensory terms was, strictly speaking, non-sense. So ideas, thoughts, concepts and other bastards of this sort were to be dismissed as things with no meaning. Words – being physically observable, directly sensible things – became the unit of meaning.

This noble effort posed difficulties of its own. Most notably, certain words had a rather peculiarly 'unsensory' character, to put it rather mildly. Conjunctives, prepositions and indexical terms, for instance – the ‘and’s ‘or’s, ‘on’s and ‘here's of this world, for instance, were in no obvious way derivable from any kind of observable sense data. Yet these were demonstrably meaningful and, indeed – necessary beasts, if any successful communication was to be had. So much the worse for words, they said. Empiricism had to be inflated, if knowledge was to be demystified. And so it was that the empiricists' second innovation was realised; by rejecting the attribution of meaning to free-floating words, terms and tokens. These were deficient, crude proxies which had to be furnished with something more. That something more was *context* – and more precisely, the context of the sentence. A problematic word, the empiricists reasoned, imposed a far lesser threat within the confines of a sentence. And so long as there existed another meaningful sentence into which any offending terms could be paraphrased, then any word could be harmlessly recast in terms of yet more sentences. Sense had been recovered.

But this too was a temporary restructuring – the sentinels of sense could not hold their sentences for long. And, as with any good, sentential seizure meant further inflation. This would come in the shape of a more centralised contextual authority: *the system*. The system comprised the framework, the grammar, the theory within which sentences hung together. Much like its antecedent, this third shift embodied the belief among philosophers that a sentence could not be extracted, understood or inspected in any vacuum. A sentence, to put it differently, is an exquisitely nested edge, whose beginning and ending periods form corners, intersecting with other sentences, in a web of threaded edges and corners! What remains when one corner has been extracted from its surrounding sides? Certainly not something as offensively preposterous as an isolated corner! Empirical claims, according to this new doctrine, were to be considered as resting upon groupings of sentences dependent on various auxiliary sentences, axiomatic sentences, background sentences, and so on and so forth in the fractal web of sentence space.

Recognition of this fact spawned a somewhat surprising result; that sentences – individual statements – could neither be verified or falsified in themselves. Rather, if a given scientific statement failed for this or that reason, only the entire edifice, taken as a whole, as a ‘corporate body’ could be found wanting – precisely because the sentence itself was no longer a locus of meaning.

There lay a clear deathblow to Quine's first dogma of empiricism: reductionism. The second – the existence of an analytic/synthetic divide – would soon dissolve with it.

If statements are not objects of meaning, then the supposed existence of analytic statements – those deemed to be true by virtue of the meaning of their constituent terms – within the corporate body could no more be accepted than could the existence of intrinsically blue or green sentences – much less bleen or grue sentences. Analytic statements could be straightforwardly rejected:

>“The organizing role that was supposedly the role of analytic sentences is now seen as shared by sentences generally, and the empirical content that was supposed peculiar to synthetic sentences is now seen as diffused through the system”

In other words, since theories only bear meaning as a whole, and not as isolable ideas, words or sentences, we can drop this entire synthetic/analytic charade altogether. There’s simply no sense to whether or not a given statement is analytic or synthetic. Sentences are not vehicles of meaning, and nor do they 'derive' as much from the rest of the system, as it were. Only the system itself, as a whole, as an organismic blur carries meaning. To ask whether that blur is an analytic blur or a synthetic blur is like looking to the heavens and asking whether the cloud up above is a wet one: neither a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ can appreciably eliminate the misconception. The only appropriate response is to elaborate why no suitable answer exists.

Having eliminated analytic statements, the fifth empiricist achievement follows closely in toe: no ‘first philosophy’ can ever exist. In other words – enough of your Popish metaphysics. Absent the analytic/synthetic division of labour, the chasm alleged to separate science from non-science simply draws in on itself. We can be uncowering naturalists. We can not only get on with the business of probing the scientific landscape; better still, we can expropriate the philosopher's once cordoned-off territory. The great nuclear blob of naturalism swallows its progenitors along with any artificial demarcations they may have erected.

This is our final result: holism is empiricism's final destination, and with it, a death knell for philosophy – or at least, philosophy as we have known it.

Philosophy, insofar as we can still respectably refer to anything of the sort, is left with little choice but to relax its authoritative grip upon the abstract, normative, or analytic species of our world. The philosopher must forfeit his status as nature’s butcher. His new station, his most 'natural' purpose, is simply to ward us off his farm – lest we repeat the mistake of his forebears in falling into the metaphysical slurry pit. Or as Daniel Dennett’s ‘bumper sticker slogan’ puts it, philosophy is ‘what you’re doing until you figure out just what questions to ask’. It is only once your thoughts have been pruned of any lingering nonsensical baggage, held up against the light of historical foolishness, disabused of all sophomoric pretensions, that they may be submitted. 'Submitted where?' you ask. Submitted, why of course, to the scientists for empirical testing.

The upshot is that philosophy is, to put a finer point on it, *for* science. In the same way that one employs a research assistant to comb through rough unsympathetically collated spreadsheets for the purposes of 'real' data analysis, or to prepare the apparatus for the 'real' experiment, so too the philosopher's efforts may be usefully and mechanically repurposed towards a kind of pedantic fussing over the reductios, circularities, and non-sequiturs bound to crop up before the 'real' thinking begins. Because, again, there are no philosophical problems – only failures to clarify one's thoughts. Thinking clearly means no longer doing philosophy, means generating scientific hypotheses. And who could ever be tempted to challenge such an orthodoxy, given the data – existing as it does (or more accurately, as it increasingly doesn't) in the philosophy departments.
