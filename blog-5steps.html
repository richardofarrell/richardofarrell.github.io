    <h1>5 Steps to the Destruction of Philosophy</h1>
        <p>According to Quine, empiricism took five positive turns after Hume: </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">“The first is the shift from ideas to words. The second is the shift of semantic focus from terms to sentences. The third is the shift of semantic focus from sentences to systems of sentences. The fourth is, in Morton White’s phrase, methodological monism: the abandonment of the analytic-synthetic distinction. The fifth is naturalism: abandonment of the goal of a first philosophy prior to science.”</p>
        
        <p>The first turn – from ideas to words – was accomplished by the British empiricists who were concerned, as Quine says, to make sense out of the senses. To ground knowledge on an empirically observable basis. Ideas were problematic in this regard because they were abstract – and therefore not readily translatable into sense data. Ideas, thoughts, concepts were to be dismissed as meaningless; words became the unit, so to speak, of meaning, and only inasmuch as they could successfully bear the sensory data.</p>
        
        <p>This effort, noble as it was, posed its own difficulties. Chiefly, certain words had a rather peculiar, unsensory character. Conjunctives and prepositions like ‘and’ ‘or’, ‘on’ and ‘there', for instance, were in no obvious way derivable from any kind of sensory data, yet seemed at once meaningful and necessary for conversation. So much for words, they said. Empiricism had to go further if knowledge was to be grounded. It was not enough merely to attribute content to particular words or terms in isolation: the word had to be furnished with sufficient context. That context would come in the form of the sentence. A problematic word, the empiricists reasoned, represented a lesser threat within the self-contained environment of a sentence – so long as there existed another meaningful sentence by which the offending term could be harmlessly paraphrased.</p>
        
        <p>Sentences, however, would themselves fall to a thirst for yet further context. Sentences succumbed to the contextual power of the <i></i>system</i> – the framework, the grammar, the theory which comprised the set of sentences. This shift embodied the belief among philosophers that a sentence within a given theory could not be extracted, understood or inspected in any vacuum. Scientific claims, it was rather asserted, rested upon further sentences, themselves conditional on various auxiliary sentences, axiomatic sentences, background sentences, and so on and so forth. This brought with it the somewhat surprising result that sentences – i.e., individual claims – could neither be verified or falsified in themselves. Rather, when a sentence fails, only the entire edifice, taken as a whole, as a ‘corporate body’ could be considered deficient – precisely because the sentence itself is not a meaningful unit.</p> 
        
        <p>Therein lay the deathblow to the first dogma of empiricism: reductionism. The second – the existence of an analytic/synthetic divide – would soon dissolve with it.</p>
        
        <p>If statements are not objects of meaning, then the supposed existence of analytic statements – those deemed to be true by virtue of the meaning of their constituent terms – within any corporate body could no longer threaten the whole. Analytic statements could then be straightforwardly rejected:</p>
        
        <p class="indented-paragraph">“The organizing role that was supposedly the role of analytic sentences is now seen as shared by sentences generally, and the empirical content that was supposed peculiar to synthetic sentences is now seen as diffused through the system”</p>
        
        <p>In other words, because we’re dealing with whole theories, and not isolable statements, we can drop the synthetic/analytic business altogether: there are no parts, it’s one big blur. So there’s simply no sense to whether or not a given statement is analytic or synthetic. Sentences don’t have intrinsic meaning as statements, nor do they derive meaning from the rest of the system. Only the system itself, as a whole, bears meaning. To ask whether the blur is an analytic blur or a synthetic blur is like asking whether the cloud is wet: neither a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ will appreciably eliminate the misconception; the more appropriate response is simply to explain why no suitable answer can be provided.</p>
        
        <p>With the elimination of analytic statements, the fifth empiricist step follows neatly in tow: no ‘first philosophy’ can ever exist. Absent an analytic/synthetic distinction, the chasm which separates science from metaphysics disappears. We can be uncowering naturalists.</p>
        
        <p>And there you have it: empiricism leads to holism, and holism leads to the end of philosophy. All completed in five short steps.</p>
        
        <p>The implication is that philosophy, if we can still respectably refer to anything of the sort, should relax its authoritative claim to the abstract, normative, or analytic species of our universe. So stripped of its shiny toys, philosophy forfeits its status as the carver of nature’s joints; philosophy adopts the posture of the lawyer whose purpose is to inform the scientists; to advise them on their rights and responsibilities – on what they can and cannot tolerably do within the strictures of respectable thinking. Or, to borrow Daniel Dennett’s ‘bumper sticker slogan’, philosophy is ‘what you’re doing until you figure out just what questions to ask’. Only once the questions have been clarified, made precise enough, pruned of all vestigial metaphysical baggage can they then be submitted to the scientists for empirical testing.</p>
        
        <p>I reject almost all of this, and will try to say why sometime soon.</p></h2>
