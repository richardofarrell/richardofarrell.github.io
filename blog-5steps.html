    <h1>5 Steps to the Destruction of Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Empiricism took five positive turns after Hume, according to Quine: </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">“The first is the shift from ideas to words. The second is the shift of semantic focus from terms to sentences. The third is the shift of semantic focus from sentences to systems of sentences. The fourth is, in Morton White’s phrase, methodological monism: the abandonment of the analytic-synthetic distinction. The fifth is naturalism: abandonment of the goal of a first philosophy prior to science.”</p>
        
        <p>The first turn – from ideas to words – was accomplished by the British empiricists. Concerned, as Quine says, to 'make sense out of the senses', to ground knowledge on an empirically observable basis, the empiricists diagnosed 'ideas' as problematic because of their abstract character. What was abstract was not readily translatable into any kind of sense data, and what could not be derived from sensory data was nonsense. For this reason ideas, thoughts, concepts and the like were to be dismissed as meaningless; words became the new unit of meaning, and only inasmuch as they could successfully bear the sensory data.</p>
        
        <p>This effort, noble as it was, posed difficulties of its own. Namely, certain words had a rather peculiarly unsensory character. Conjunctives and prepositions like ‘and’ ‘or’, ‘on’ and ‘there', for instance, were in no obvious way derivable from any kind of sensory data, yet seemed at once meaningful and necessary for conversation. So much for words, they said. Empiricism had to go further if knowledge was to be grounded. It was not enough merely to attribute meaning to free-floating words or terms: such things had to be furnished with sufficient context. That context would come in the form of the sentence. A problematic word, the empiricists reasoned, represented a lesser threat within the self-contained environment of a sentence – so long as there existed another meaningful sentence by which the offending term could be harmlessly paraphrased.</p>
        
        <p>Sentences, however, would themselves fall to a thirst for yet further context. Sentences succumbed to the contextual power of the <i>system</i> – the framework, the grammar, the theory comprising the set of sentences of interest. This shift embodied the belief among philosophers that a sentence within a given theory could not be extracted, understood or inspected in any vacuum. Scientific or empirical claims, it was rather to be asserted, rest upon further sentences, themselves conditional on various auxiliary sentences, axiomatic sentences, background sentences, and so on and so forth. This recognition in turn prompted the somewhat surprising result that sentences – i.e., individual claims or statements – could neither be verified or falsified in themselves. Rather, if a sentence fails, only the entire edifice, taken as a whole, as a ‘corporate body’ can be considered deficient – precisely because the sentence itself is no longer to be treated as a meaningful unit.</p> 
        
        <p>Therein lay the deathblow to the first dogma of empiricism: reductionism. The second – the existence of an analytic/synthetic divide – would soon dissolve with it.</p>
        
        <p>If statements are not objects of meaning, then the supposed existence of analytic statements – those deemed to be true by virtue of the meaning of their constituent terms – within the corporate body can no more be endorsed than can the existence of intrinsically blue or green sentences – much less blue-green sentences. Analytic statements can be straightforwardly rejected:</p>
        
        <p class="indented-paragraph">“The organizing role that was supposedly the role of analytic sentences is now seen as shared by sentences generally, and the empirical content that was supposed peculiar to synthetic sentences is now seen as diffused through the system”.</p>
        
        <p>In other words, because we’re dealing with whole theories, and not isolable ideas, words or statements, we can drop the synthetic/analytic business altogether: there are no parts, just a big blur. There’s no sense to whether or not a given statement is analytic or synthetic, since sentences are not vehicles of meaning. Nor do they 'derive' meaning from the rest of the system, as it were. Only the system itself, as a whole, bears meaning. To ask whether the blur is an analytic blur or a synthetic blur is like asking whether the cloud is wet: neither a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ will appreciably eliminate the misconception; the more appropriate response is to adumbrate why no suitable answer can be provided.</p>
        
        <p>With the elimination of analytic statements, the fifth empiricist achievement follows closely in tow: no ‘first philosophy’ can ever exist. Absent the analytic/synthetic division of labour, the chasm alleged to separate science from metaphysics draws in on itself. We can be uncowering naturalists. We can not only get on with the business of probing the scientific landscape; better still, we can appropriate the philosopher's sovereign territory. The great blob of naturalism swallows philosophy. </p>
        
        <p>This is our final result: empiricism leads to holism, and holism leads to the end of philosophy – or at least, the end of philosophy as we have known it. And all of this in five simple steps.</p>
        
        <p>So it stands to reason that philosophy, if we can still respectably refer to anything of the sort, should relax its authoritative claim to the abstract, normative, analytic species of our universe. So stripped of its toys, philosophy forfeits its status as the carver of nature’s joints; the philosopher adopts the stance of the lawmaker, a de facto regulator or bureacurat informing the scientists of her rights and responsibilities – on what can and cannot tolerably be proposed within the strictures of respectable logical thought. In the words of Daniel Dennett’s ‘bumper sticker slogan’, philosophy obtains the status of ‘what you’re doing until you figure out just what questions to ask’. Only once the questions have been clarified, pruned of all vestigial metaphysical baggage, filtered through the lens of previous mistaken steps – only then can they be submitted to the scientists for empirical testing.</p>
        
        <p>The upshot is that philosophy is <i>for</i> science. Just as a research assistant combs through rough datasets for the purposes of <i>real data analysis</i>, or prepares equipment for the <i>real experiment</i>, so the philosopher points out the silly reductios and circular reasoning which abound before any <i>real thinking</i> begins. There are no real philosophical problems; only failures of imagination.</p>
        
        <p>One wonders what the philosophers could possibly be confused about when they don't know which questions to ask.</p></h2>
