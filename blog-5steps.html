    <h1>5 Steps to the Destruction of Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Empiricism took five positive turns after Hume, according to Quine: </p>

        <p class="indented-paragraph">“The first is the shift from ideas to words. The second is the shift of semantic focus from terms to sentences. The third is the shift of semantic focus from sentences to systems of sentences. The fourth is, in Morton White’s phrase, methodological monism: the abandonment of the analytic-synthetic distinction. The fifth is naturalism: abandonment of the goal of a first philosophy prior to science.”</p>
        
        <p>The first turn – from ideas to words – was accomplished by the British empiricists. Concerned, as Quine says, to 'make sense out of the senses', to ground knowledge on an empirically observable basis, the empiricists diagnosed 'ideas' as problematic because of their abstract character. What was abstract was not readily translatable into any kind of sense data, and what could not be derived from sensory data was, strictly speaking, nonsense. So ideas, thoughts, concepts and the like were to be dismissed as things with no meaning; words became the new unit of meaning, and only inasmuch as they could successfully bear the relevant sensory data.</p>
        
        <p>This effort, noble as it was, posed difficulties of its own. Certain words had a rather peculiarly unsensory character. Conjunctives and prepositions like ‘and’ ‘or’, ‘on’ and ‘there', for instance, were in no obvious way derivable from any kind of sensory data, yet seemed demonstrably meaningful and indeed quite necessary for conversation. So much for words, they said. Empiricism had to be inflated, if indeed knowledge was to be grounded. It was not enough merely to attribute meaning to free-floating words or terms; such things had to be furnished with something more: context. That context would come in the form of the sentence. A problematic word, the empiricists reasoned, represented a much less imposing threat within the self-contained walls of a sentence. So long as there existed another meaningful sentence by which offending terms could be harmlessly paraphrased, then any word could be cashed out in terms of yet further sentences.</p>
        
        <p>Sentences, however, would themselves yield to a thirst for still more context: to the contextual power of the <i>system</i> – the framework, the grammar, the theory comprising the set of sentences of interest. This shift embodied the belief among philosophers that a given sentence within a given theory could not be extracted, understood or inspected in any vacuum. Scientific or empirical claims, it was rather discovered, rested upon further sentences, themselves conditional on various auxiliary sentences, axiomatic sentences, background sentences, and so on and so forth. Recognition of this fact spawned the somewhat surprising result that sentences – i.e., individual claims or statements – could neither be verified or falsified in themselves. Rather, if a given scientific statement failed, only the entire edifice, taken as a whole, as a ‘corporate body’ could be considered deficient – precisely because the sentence itself was no longer to be considered a meaningful unit.</p> 
        
        <p>Therein lay the deathblow to the first dogma of empiricism: reductionism. The second – the existence of an analytic/synthetic divide – would soon dissolve with it.</p>
        
        <p>If statements are not objects of meaning, then the supposed existence of analytic statements – those deemed to be true by virtue of the meaning of their constituent terms – within the corporate body can no more be endorsed than can the existence of intrinsically blue or green sentences – much less blue-green sentences. Analytic statements can be straightforwardly rejected:</p>
        
        <p class="indented-paragraph">“The organizing role that was supposedly the role of analytic sentences is now seen as shared by sentences generally, and the empirical content that was supposed peculiar to synthetic sentences is now seen as diffused through the system”.</p>
        
        <p>In other words, since we’re dealing with whole theories, and not isolable ideas, words or statements, we can drop the synthetic/analytic business altogether. There’s no sense to whether or not a given statement is analytic or synthetic, since sentences are not vehicles of meaning. Nor do they 'derive' meaning from the rest of the system, as it were. Only the system itself, as a whole, as an organismic blur, bears meaning. To ask whether the blur is an analytic blur or a synthetic blur is like pointing to the sky and asking whether the cloud up above is a wet one: neither a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ can appreciably eliminate the misconception; the more appropriate response is to elaborate why no suitable answer can be provided.</p>
        
        <p>With the elimination of analytic statements, the fifth empiricist achievement follows closely in toe: no ‘first philosophy’ can ever exist. Absent the analytic/synthetic division of labour, the chasm alleged to separate science from metaphysics draws in on itself. We can be uncowering naturalists. We can not only get on with the business of probing the scientific landscape; better still, we can expropriate the philosopher's territory. The great blob of naturalism swallows philosophy. </p>
        
        <p>This is our final result: empiricism leads to holism, and holism leads to the end of philosophy – or at least, the end of philosophy as we have known it.</p>
        
        <p>So it stands to reason that philosophy, if we can still respectably refer to anything of the sort, must relax its authoritative claim to the abstract, normative, analytic species of our universe. So emaciated, philosophy forfeits its status as the carver of nature’s joints; the philosopher must pivot to the role of lawmaker, must become a de facto regulator, a diplomat enforcing the minutiae of what can and cannot tolerably be proposed within the strictures of respectable logical thought, divorcing propositions suitable for scientific entry from those which mustn't be let out of the waiting room. In the words of Daniel Dennett’s ‘bumper sticker slogan’, philosophy, so construed, becomes ‘what you’re doing until you figure out just what questions to ask’. Only once your thoughts have been suitably pruned of any lingering 'metaphysical' baggage, distilled of historical missteps, can they be submitted. Submitted where? Submitted, that is, to the scientists for empirical testing.</p>
        
        <p>The upshot is that philosophy is <i>for</i> science. Just as a research assistant combs through rough datasets for the purposes of <i>real data analysis</i> or prepares his supervisor's apparatus for the <i>real experiment</i>, so the philosopher pedantically fusses over the reductios, question-begging, and non-sequiturs before the <i>real thinking</i> can begin. There are no philosophical problems, only failures to think clearly. And thinking clearly means no longer doing philosophy, means generating scientific hypotheses. Because it's all just empirical, isn't it? </p>
        
        <p>...isn't it?</p></h2>
