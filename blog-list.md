# Questions

Why is nearly all of our DNA non-coding? Why does the coding proportion of a genome appear to decrease as
biological complexity increases? Why are cephalopods (seemingly) as intelligent as they are, given their
short lifespans and (seemingly) non-existent social adaptive pressures? Why are there more recurrent neural
connections than feedforward connections in the brain? Why are great ideas so often stumbled upon by
different people at roughly the same time – e.g., Leibniz and Newton, Wallace and Darwin, Turing and Post? Why
are there no known cases of congenitally blind people with schizophrenia – and why is autism so common in
blind people?
