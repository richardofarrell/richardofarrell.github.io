    <h2>Interesting Questions</h2>
    <p>Why is nearly all of our DNA non-coding? Why does the coding proportion of a genome appear to decrease as biological complexity increases? 
        Why are cephalopods (seemingly) as intelligent as they are, given their short lifespans and (seemingly) non-existent social adaptive pressures? 
        Why are their more recurrent neural connections than feedforward connections in the brain? 
        Why are great ideas so often stumbled upon by different people at roughly the same time – Leibniz and Newton, Wallace and Darwin, Turing and Post?
        Why are there no known cases of congenitally blind people with schizophrenia – and why is autism so common in blind people?</p>
